    <h2>What I like to Learn in Software Engineering:</h2>
    I'd like to learn how to upload videos on a site and add more artistic elements in web development.jQuery seems like a cool javascript shortcut.
    I'm interested in making backgrounds and themes to a website. Software is a  new territory for me, but I have a feeling that 
    there is so much more to web development, hidden-links, firewalls and programs that I already know. I want to know the different languages
    in coding. Could they blend with each other? How are languages programmed? Who comes up with these anyway?
